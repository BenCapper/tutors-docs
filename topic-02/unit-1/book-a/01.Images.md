# Changing Card Images

Lets change the default card image with your own.

1. Select an image to use. This image must be a `.jpg`, `.svg`, or `.png` file.

2. In your `tutors-starter` folder, open `topic-01` and notice the `topic.jpg` file. Delete `topic.jpg` and replace it with your own image.

3. The process is the same for all cards, simply replace the `topic.jpg` file which corresponds to the card you wish to change.
