# HEANet hosted videos

If you require an alternative to Youtube, Tutors support videos hosted on the HEANet media service:

- <https://media.heanet.ie/>

If you wish to use this service, then your videoid file should look like this:

~~~
heanet=7e4f1e9afedb40d5996d0703702eaaa4
~~~

The id will be generated when you upload the video to the HEAnet media service.

Example here :

- <http://localhost:5000/#/topic/tutors-template.netlify.app/topic-04-units>

The cover for the video will be the image associated with your topic or card.
