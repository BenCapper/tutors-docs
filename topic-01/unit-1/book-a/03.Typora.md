# About Typora

<span style="color: red">Be Aware:</span> Typora is currently free while in Beta testing, however this will change with the release of the official version.

Typora is a unique text editor for Markdown files, allowing the user to view the output of their markdown, as they write it. This greatly reduces the time required for testing page formatting.

To view the code which is in effect, just click the area which has been formatted. In this example, `Be Aware` is red due to a `<span>` tag, to see the code causing this, just click the content in question; in this case: `Be Aware`.
