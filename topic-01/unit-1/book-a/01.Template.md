# Download the Template Tutors Course

In this lab we will install some applications on your workstation:

- Node.js: required to build a tutors course


- Sublime: a text editor
- Typeora: a Markdown editor

Lets start with downloading and inspecting a Tutors sample course:



1. Download the following `.zip` file and save it to your preferred location. 

     - [Tutors Template Course](archives/tutors-starter.zip)

     Save this somewhere convenient - and keep note of where it is stored.

2. Extract the .zip file. This will depend on which archiving tool you may have installed. On windows for instance it might look like this:

     ![Extract Here](img/01x.png)

Once extracted, have a look at the layout of the contents of the folder:

This is a complete (sample) tutors course. We will examine it in more detail later.This course is currently deployed here:

- <[https://tutors-starter.netlify.app](https://tutors-starter.netlify.app/)>

Perhaps spend 2 minutes exploring the site.

See if you can relate the web experience to the layout of the files in the folder on your workstation. Each card is clickable, and the various tool bars along the top are reasonably self explanatory.
