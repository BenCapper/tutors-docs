# Republish a Course

Let's make some small changes to the site to demonstrate how to recompile a course.

Open your `tutors-starter` folder, then navigate to `topic-1`.

Notice the topic title is denoted by a `#` followed by a space, then the title text. Change this to whatever you wish. This is the text below the first card in the course:

If you make a change, then you will need to `compile` the course - and then drag and drop the Newley generated folder `json` folder to the Netlify drop area for your published site as in the last step. The `compile` process  produces a new version of the  `json` folder located within the `tutors-starter` folder. 

First, open a Command Prompt (or Terminal on Mac). Side by side open the folder where you course is located:

In the Command Prompt, type:

~~~
cd 
~~~

... make sure to leave a space at the end:

Then Drag & Drop the `tutors-starter' folder from the finder window onto the command prompt:

This will inert the full path of the folder. Press `Return or Enter` now, and the type `dir`

You Command prompt window should look as above - you have `changed` into the tutors-course folder, and verified you are there by entering the `dir` command.

To Compile the course, enter the following:

~~~
npx tutors-json
~~~

In a few minutest you should see the above - a list of the course contents - and the `json` directory will have been updated.

The final step is to drag and drop this generated folder onto the Netlify project we set up in the last step.  First, revisit the project on Netlify:

Navigate into the project:

Select `Deploys`:

You should see the Drag & Drop zone above. Proceed now to drag and drop the `json` folder again. If all goes well you should see a new deploy listed:
