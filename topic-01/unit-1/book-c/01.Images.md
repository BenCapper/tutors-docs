# Changing Card Images

Lets change the default card image with your own.

1. Select an image to use. This image must be a `.jpg`, `.svg`, or `.png` file.

2. In your `tutors-starter` folder, open `topic-01` and notice the `topic.jpg` file. Delete `topic.jpg` and replace it with your own image.
    ![Replace this File](img/chimg.png)

3. The change will be reflected in the live site during the last step of this lab.

The process is the same for all cards, simply replace the `topic.jpg` file which corresponds to the card you wish to change.
