# Update your Tutors Course

Lets make some small changes to the site to demonstrate how to change card images and titles and the process of regenerating and redeploying the Tutors file structure.

1. Open your `tutors-starter` folder, then navigate to `topic-1`.

2. Notice the topic.md file. This is the file which specifies the title of `topic-1`. Open it.

3. Notice the topic title is denoted by a `#` followed by a space, then the title text. Change this to whatever you wish.

4. You will also notice a line of text below the title. This is the topic description which will be displayed below the image on a card. Avoid using bullet points here, although `<b></b>` tags can be used to make the text bold. Change the description to whatever you wish.

10. Navigate back to the root `tutors-starter` folder and open `properties.yaml` using `Sublime Text`.

11. Enter your details on the credits line of this file and select `File` -> `Save` or press `Ctrl+S`.

In the next step you will regenerate the Tutors file structure, updated with your changes, then redeploy that file structure using Netlify.
