# Update your Tutors Course

Lets make some small changes to the site to demonstrate how to change card images and titles and the process of regenerating and redeploying the Tutors file structure.

1. Open your `tutors-starter` folder, then navigate to `topic-1`.

2. Notice the topic.md file. This is the file which specifies the title of `topic-1`. Open it.

3. Notice the topic title is denoted by a `#` followed by a space, then the title text. Change this to whatever you wish.

4. You will also notice a line of text below the title. This is the topic description which will be displayed below the image on a card. Avoid using bullet points here, although `<b></b>` tags can be used to make the text bold. Change the description to whatever you wish.

5. Back in your `File Explorer`, inside the topic-1 folder, you will notice a `topic.jpg` file. This is the file which dictates the card image for topic-1. You can delete this file and replace it with any `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.svg` image file.

In the next step you will regenerate the Tutors file structure, updated with your changes, then redeploy that file structure using Netlify.
